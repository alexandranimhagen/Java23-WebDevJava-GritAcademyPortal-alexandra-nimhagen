Grit Academy Portal â€“ Full-Stack Java Web App

A full-stack Java web application developed as part of the Web Development course at Grit Academy. The portal demonstrates backend and frontend integration, CRUD operations, and form handling using Java and Spring Boot.

Features

- User-friendly frontend built with HTML, CSS, and Thymeleaf (or JSP)
- Backend powered by Spring Boot and Spring MVC
- RESTful API endpoints for CRUD operations
- Form handling with server-side validation
- Error handling and user feedback
- Database integration for persistent storage

Technologies Used

- Java  
- Spring Boot  
- Spring MVC  
- Thymeleaf or JSP  
- H2 / PostgreSQL / MySQL (relational database)  
- Maven or Gradle (build tool)

How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alexandranimhagen/Java23-WebDevJava-GritAcademyPortal-alexandra-nimhagen.git
Open the project in your preferred Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ or Eclipse)

Configure the database (H2 is pre-configured for testing)

Run the application:

mvn spring-boot:run
Open your browser at http://localhost:8080

Use the web interface to interact with data (e.g., forms, lists, CRUD)

What I Learned
Through this project, I learned to:

Develop full-stack Java web applications

Integrate frontend templates with backend logic

Handle forms, validate input, and return feedback

Design and interact with a relational database

Structure a maintainable Spring Boot project

This project was created as my final assignment in the Web Development module at Grit Academy and showcases my skills in Java, Spring, and full-stack web development
